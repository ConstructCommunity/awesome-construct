# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## The pull request should have a useful title. Pull requests with `Update readme.md` as title will be closed right away.

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

### Beforehand

- If you submit a project that is similar to an existing project in the list, argument how it's better.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.

### Format

- Use the following format: `- [Name](link) - Description.`
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.

**Examples:**

- ✅ `- [iOS](…) - Mobile operating system for Apple phones and tablets.`
- ✅ `- [Framer](…) - Prototyping interactive UI designs.`
- ❌ `- [iOS](…) - Resources and tools for iOS development.`
- ❌ `- [Framer](…)`
- ❌ `- [Framer](…) - prototyping interactive UI designs`

**About Content:**

For content be sure to follow any of these conventions:
- `- [Author's Name](link) - Description.` If your content must be referred to in a generic non-identifiable way.
- `- [Author: Name](link) - Description.` If your content has a concrete identifiable name.

### Considerations

- Don't mention `Construct 2` or `Construct 3` in the description as it's implied. If it's strictly necessary, just use `Construct`. 
- Always prefer to link to the GitHub repo if any.
- Additions should be added in an alphabetical way on the relevant category.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestion!

### Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
